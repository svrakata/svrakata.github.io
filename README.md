# Personal site

## Plan

0. Check portfolio/presonal websites for validation and what is out there
    * First "top 10 websites" article has 2 good websites the rest are either the same or not accurate.
1. What it should not be:
    * Best, most, more, good, all. 
    * Presenting skills and technologies I don't know or barely know.
    * Scroll animations, sliding boxes, fat tech logos with progress bars. WTF is knowing CSS 90%, js 69%? Can you write lodash from scratch? Can you write js interpeter in js? How objecst work under the hood? Is that conciderate cent of that percentage?


What I want with this website is first of all to avoid wasting time, mine or that of the one reading it. 
I want to be accurate about my skills and the way I percieve programming, computer science and web development.

The most important things! :

Often I'm in a situation where my lack of knowledge and experience brings me to a dead end while solving a problem. 
I realised that knowing a list of technologies (programming language, library, framework) is not enough and decided to deal with that by focusing on computer science and fundamentals like data structures, algorithms, programming paradigms and coding on a daily basis. That just brought me to the ocean of things I don't know but want to learn.

List out everything that is in your head:

golang ---> and some close to the metal prog language
python ---> cause i like it and can help me understand more about everything
data structures and algos ---> so many books courses trainitg tutorial problems to slove
web dev
typescript
nodejs
react
js keep deep diving
build process and prcedures
deploying process and procedures
bg nature project
server techs ? nextjs express nodejs gatsby graphql api restful
bioinformatics
computer science
data
databases
infrastructures
web, internet and how it works
os --> unix based shell/bash scripting
vim --> incresing productivity
problem solving
philosophy of computer science and all the whys 
version control
normal workflows
architectures and best practicies
tools and tools developed on your own

fullstackway for the next 3 months:
js keep deep diving it
typescript --> finish the udemy course
nodejs --> finish the udemy project
bg nature ---> to practice 
avoid starting new technologies and just focus on those who can improve your skills in as much levels as possible
for example --> nestjs is a good choise because is ts based and is backedn frame based on nodejs
bare nodejs is also good as it helps you learn more about event driven architecture, callbacks handling, async programming 
reactjs --> dig deep to the fundamentals just before the source // --> 
datastructures and algos ---> the python book
